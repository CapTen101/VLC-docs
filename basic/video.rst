2. To return to the original mode, press :kbd:`Esc` on the keyboard or right-click the mouse and select the :guilabel:`Leave Full Screen` option. The video will then return to its original mode.

This option is useful if you want to capture a portion of the video as an image. To capture an image from the video, Click on :menuselection:`Video --> Take Snapshot`.

You can enlarge videos in different sizes. This option is useful if you want to change the size of a video track which is being played. 
The supported sizes are 1:4 Quarter, 1:2 Half, 1:1 Original (default) and 2:1 Double. To view a video in a particular dimension, select a dimension in :menuselection:`Video --> Zoom`.

The track is then resized based on the selected zoom ratio.

Aspect Ratio
************

Aspect ratio refers to the width of a picture in relation to its height. For example, the ratio 4:3 means four units wide to three units high. VLC provides a list of aspect ratio values which are Default, 1:1, 4:3, 16:9, 16:10, 2.21:1, 2.35:1, 2.39:1 and 5:4.

To select an aspect ratio, select a value from :menuselection:`Video --> Aspect Ratio` menu. Then video is then adjusted based on the selected ratio.
