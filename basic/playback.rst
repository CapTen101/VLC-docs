You can mark and locate particular places in an audio or video file using the Bookmarks feature of VLC. If you want to view a particular scene in a movie or listen to certain tune in a song repeatedly, you can create bookmarks.

To bookmark a scene in a video, follow the steps below:

1. On the menu bar, click on :menuselection:`Menu --> Playback`.
