VLC features a 10-band graphical equalizer, a device used to alter the relative frequencies of audio (e.g. for a bass boost). 
You can display it by selecting :menuselection:`Tools --> Effects and Filters --> Audio Effects --> Equalizer` on Windows or GNU/Linux or by clicking the :guilabel:`Equalizer` button on the macOS interface.

Additional Audio Effects
========================

From the :guilabel:`Audio Effects` menu, you can also access the following effects:

Compressor
   emulates a dynamic range compressor
Spatializer
   changes audio as if it was produced inside a room
Stereo Widener
   enhances the stereo effect by suppressing mono (signal common to both channels) and by delaying the signal of left into right and vice versa, thereby widening the stereo effect.
Advanced
   From this menu, you can adjust the audio pitch.

Synchronization
***************
 
VLC's synchronization feature allows you to fix an audio/video file that is not synced by either deplaying or hastening the audio or subtitle till it is synced.
Sometimes, while playing video files, you hear the sound before the actual time or you hear spoken words only after the lips move. 
This means that the audio is not in sync and you will have to fix the audio delay. To do this, click on :guilabel:`Tools` menu
and select :guilabel:`Audio Synchronisation` from the dropdown menu, enter a positive numerical value to increase hasten the speed or a negative value
to decrease the speed. Audio synchronization can also be done easily using Hotkeys. See how to use hotkeys for Audio synchronization below:
 
* Step 1 : Detect (hear) that audio is out of sync
* Step 2 : If your audio requires to be slowed down then hit the ‘K‘ hotkey from your keyboard. For the opposite of this hit the ‘J‘ hotkey on your keyboard. For Mac, the shortcut keys are ‘G‘ and ‘F‘. A confirmation will be displayed on the top-right area of your screen.
* Step 3 : Pressing the hotkeys once will speed up or slow down the audio by 50 milliseconds. If you continue to press it, the number of milliseconds will continuously be incremented.
* Step 4 : Speed up or slow down the sound timing of the video until you reach the desired state. Make sure that the video is playing and listen to the sound carefully and match it with the video to do this.
