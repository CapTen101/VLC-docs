This menu gives you access to all the settings that establish the behaviour of VLC. Each section of preferences comes in two flavours: :guilabel:`Simple` and :guilabel:`Advanced`.
The simple preferences are settings for the most commonly used parameters of the application while the advanced settings require some deeper knowledge to use them effectively.
