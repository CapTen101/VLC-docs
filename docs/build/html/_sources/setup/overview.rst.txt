**Common questions**

**What are the system requirements for VS Code?**
We have a list of System Requirements.

**How big is VS Code?**
VS Code is a small download (< 100 MB) and has a disk footprint of less than 200 MB, so you can quickly install VS Code and try it out.

**How do I create and run a new project?**
VS Code doesn't include a traditional File > New Project dialog or pre-installed project templates. You'll need to add additional components and scaffolders depending on your development interests. With scaffolding tools like Yeoman and the multitude of modules available through the npm package manager, you're sure to find appropriate templates and tools to create your projects.

**How do I know which version I'm running?**
On Linux and Windows, choose Help > About. On macOS, use Code > About Visual Studio Code.

**Why is VS Code saying my installation is Unsupported?**
VS Code has detected that some installation files have been modified, perhaps by an extension. Reinstalling VS Code will replace the affected files. See our FAQ topic for more details.
