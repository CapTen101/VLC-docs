"There are several applications that are used to reverse the stereo "
"whereas VLC has an in-built feature to reverse the stereo. This option is"
" useful if you want the audio to play in tandem with the video. You can "
"use the Reverse Stereo option if you want to deliberately change the "
"audio output. Imagine that you are watching a video. In the video, a "
"person walks on the left side but the sound is produced on the right "
"speaker. You can correct this by selecting the Reverse Stereo option in "
"VLC. Select the Reverse Stereo option and play the same scene in the "
"video and observe the difference."
