"The easiest way to conform to the GPL is to accompany the product you "
"want to distribute with its sources. For example, if you plan to "
"distribute the latest binary version of VLC on a DVD-ROM, you should also"
" include the `VLC sources <https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-"
"sources.html>`_ on the same medium. If you plan to distribute the latest "
"binary version of VLC on a website, you should provide a link to the `VLC"
" sources <https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-sources.html>`_. There "
"are other ways to comply with the GPL, but this should be the simplest "
"because it does not rely on a contract."

"Some of the codecs distributed with VLC are patented and require you to "
"pay royalties to their licensors. These are mostly the MPEG style codecs."
" With many products the producer pays the license body (in this case "
"`MPEG LA <http://www.mpegla.com/>`_) so the user (commercial or personal)"
" does not have to take care of this. VLC (and ffmpeg and libmpeg2 â€“ which"
" it uses in most of these cases) cannot do this because they are Free and"
" Open Source implementations of these codecs. The software is not sold, "
"and therefore the end-user becomes responsible for complying with the "
"licensing and royalty requirements. You will need to contact the licensor"
" on how to comply with these licenses. This goes for playing a DVD with "
"VLC for your personal enjoyment ($2.50 one time payment to MPEG LA) as "
"well as for using VLC for streaming a live event in MPEG-4 over the "
"Internet."
