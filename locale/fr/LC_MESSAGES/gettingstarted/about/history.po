"The VideoLAN project was started as a school project in 1996 by students "
"of `Ecole Centrale Paris <https://www.centralesupelec.fr>`_, a French "
"engineering school in 1996. These students wanted to be able to watch "
"television on their PCs. They also wanted to upgrade the VIA Centrale "
"Réseaux network so they needed a bandwidth intensive application to "
"justify the upgrade. So they began writing VLS (VideoLAN Server) and the "
"VLC (VideoLAN Client) to stream and read MPEG-2 streams. They succeeded "
"in serving and reading the first stream in 1998. These two programs were "
"planned to be modular, which meant a core consisting basically of "
"communication functions to be used by the modules. This allowed easy "
"porting of the OS specific modules."

"In 2001, after many months (if not years) of negotiation, the `school's "
"Director agreed to a change to the GPL licence "
"<https://images.videolan.org/images/paper.jpeg>`_. Developers from all "
"around the world started working on the project right away. One of them "
"(gibalou) even submitted the Win32 port 6 months later! The first large "
"scale multicast streaming tests occurred in May 2002. 500 students on the"
" VIA Centrale Réseaux network were able to participate in these tests. In"
" January 2003, the first MPEG4 streams were tested and realtime MPEG4 "
"encoding was available two months later."

"The project started to open up to developers outside of the École. It is "
"now a worldwide project with `developers "
"<https://www.videolan.org/videolan/team/>`_ from 40 countries. Since "
"2009, the project is completely separated from École Centrale Paris, and "
"is driven by an autonomous non-profit organization."

"VLC used to stand for **VideoLAN Client** when VLC was a client of the "
"VideoLAN project. Now, the initialism no longer applies because VLC is no"
" longer merely a client. Originally VideoLAN was designed to stream MPEG "
"videos on high-bandwidth networks, but VideoLAN's main software, VLC "
"media player, has evolved to become a full-featured, cross-platform media"
" player. Now, the Non-Profit Organisation developing and offering the VLC"
" media player is called: VideoLAN Organisation."
