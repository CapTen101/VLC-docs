VLC media player helps you to create media files. After creating media files, the quality has to be tested. You can test the quality and several other parameters using playback. In playback, you can specify parameters such as time, bookmarks, and titles.

Bookmarks

You can mark and locate particular places in an audio or video file using the Bookmarks feature of VLC. If you want to view a particular scene in a movie or listen to certain tune in a song repeatedly, you can create bookmarks.

To bookmark a scene in a video, follow the steps below:

To play a chapter:

2. Locate the folder in which the video files are present.
3. Select a video file and click **OK** and the file will be played in the VLC media player.

This option is enabled only if streams of format DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) and TS are played. Choose the program to select by giving its Service ID. Only use this option if you want to read a multi-program stream (like DVB streams for example). FIXME: Description needs to be improved
