You can mark and locate particular places in an audio or video file using the Bookmarks feature of VLC. If you want to view a particular scene in a movie or listen to certain tune in a song repeatedly, you can create bookmarks.

To bookmark a scene in a video, follow the steps below:

1. On the menu bar, click on :menuselection:`Menu --> Playback`.

This option is enabled only if streams of format DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) and TS are played. Choose the program to select by giving its Service ID. Only use this option if you want to read a multi-program stream (like DVB streams for example). FIXME: Description needs to be improved
