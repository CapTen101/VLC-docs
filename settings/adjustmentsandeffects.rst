Video filters
Summary
VLC features several filters able to change the video (distortion, brightness adjustment, motion blurring, etc.).

In Windows and Linux, the user must go to the Effects and Filters in the Tools menu item. A dialogue box entitled "Adjustments and Effects" will appear.

In macOS you can enable these filters through the Extended Controls panel. Click on the triangle next to Video filters to select your filters or expand the Adjust Image section to change the contrast, hue, etc.

Audio filters
Equalizer
Wikipedia has information on this entry:
Equalization (audio)
VLC features a 10-band graphical equalizer, a device used to alter the relative frequencies of audio (e.g. for a bass boost). You can display it by activating the advanced GUI on wxWidgets or by clicking the Equalizer button on the macOS interface. The following image is the interface of the audio equalizer in the Windows and GNU/Linux interface.

Presets are available in all of these dialog boxes.

Other audio filters
At the moment, VLC features two other audio filters: a volume normalizer and a filter providing sound spatialization with a headphone. They can be enabled in the Effects and Filters menu item in the Tools tab of the Windows and GNU/Linux interface and in the Audio section of the Extended Controls panel of the macOS interface.

For better control, you need to go to the preferences. To select the filters to be enabled, go to Audio, then to Filters. In the "audio filters" box, enter the names of the filters to enable, separated by commas. Valid names are "equalizer", "normvol" and "headphone".

If you want to tune the behavior of these filters, go to Audio, Filters, [your filter]. The equalizer and headphone filters can be tuned.
