This menu gives you access to all the settings that establish the behaviour of VLC. Each section of preferences comes in two flavours: :guilabel:`ordinary` and :guilabel:`advanced.`
The ordinary preferences are settings for the simpler parameters of the application while the advanced settings require some deeper knowledge to use them effectively.
