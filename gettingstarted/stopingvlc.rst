Stopping VLC
============
There are three ways to quit VLC:

Right click the VLC icon (LargeVLC.png) in the tray and select Quit (Alt-F4).
Click the Close button in the main interface of the application.
In the Media menu, select Quit (Ctrl-Q).

   :align:   center

.. figure::  /static/images/interface/Notification_Area_Icon_LargeVLC.png
   :align:   center


Clicking this icon shows or hides the VLC interface. Hiding VLC does not exit the application. VLC keeps running in the background when it is hidden. Right clicking the icon in the notification area shows a menu with basic operations, such as opening, playing, stopping, or changing a media file.
