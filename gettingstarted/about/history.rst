VideoLAN's History
******************

**Overview of the VideoLAN project**

The VideoLan software originated as an academic project at the 
`French Ecole Centrale Paris <https://www.centralesupelec.fr>`_ in 1996. 
After a complete rewrite in 1998, it became Open Source, thanks to the agreement of the École Centrale Paris, in 2001 under the under the `GNU General Public License (GPL) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>`_. The project started to open up to developers outside of the École. It is now a worldwide project with developers from 40 countries.

It is now a worldwide project with `developers <https://www.videolan.org/videolan/team/>`_ from 40 countries. Since 2009, the project is completely separated from École Centrale Paris, and is driven by an autonomous non-profit organization.
 
VLC used to stand for **VideoLAN Client** when VLC was a client of the VideoLAN project. Now, the initialism no longer applies 
because VLC is no longer merely a client. Originally VideoLAN was designed to stream MPEG videos on high-bandwidth networks, but VideoLAN's main software, 
VLC media player, has evolved to become a full-featured, cross-platform media player. Now, the Non-Profit Organisation developing and offering the VLC media player is called: 
VideoLAN Organisation.
