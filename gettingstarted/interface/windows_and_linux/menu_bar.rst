========

* Track slider - The track slider is below the menu bar. It shows the playing progress of the media file. You can drag the track slider left to rewind or right to forward the track being played. When a video file is played, the video is shown between the menu bar and the track slider.
    Note: When a media file is streamed, the track slider does not move because VLC cannot know the total duration.
* Control Buttons - The buttons below the track slider cover all the basic playback features.
