VLC Media Player, itself is a great one.
If you are looking to play video and audio files 
along with other supported things like subtitles, 
VLC media player needs nothing else. But if you are one of 
those who require some unique features or who want to 
extend the functions of a software, then you probably 
heard about add-ons and plugins. 
VLC Media Player has a ton of those add-ons.


VLC Media Player allows you to add some new things 
to the player. You can do new tasks with the same player. 
Adding a skin to the player is kind of an extension but 
it is related to the user interface only. There are other 
types of add-ons which allows VLC to do something different
like, load lyrics automatically for songs or load
subtitles automatically for videos. Those are some 
of the possibilities of how VLC Media Player can be 
expanded to do much more.

First of all, it is necessary to understand a bit about VLC Media Player Addons. Here are a few things that you must know about them:

1. When it comes to filetype, VLC Media Player add-ons is kind on unique. The files generally have a .lua extension. Although this extension is not unique to VLC, it still is quite a unique one for a normal PC user.

2. VLC Media Player add-ons are developed by third-parties, who are interested in extending the possibilities of VLC’s usage. Generally those third-parties are promoting their own service(s) with VLC.

3. VLC Addons are downloadable from the official VLC website. The url for it is: http://addons.videolan.org

4. Addons or .lua files are downloaded and are copied to a location in the VLC’s program files directory to be installed. No fancy install wizard or anything of that nature.

5. After copying the lua files, you will have to restart your VLC player or start a new instance of the player. Then depending upon the addon,you will find them on menu items. Click on those to activate them.


VLC does support some basic features like video playback 
control, automatic subtitles and so on. For instance, the
VLC player doesn’t remember the video positions of last 
video or movie files that were played. In this particular
scenario, say if by any chance you closed the video.
The VLC player starts playing the video all over from the 
beginning instead of automatically playing the movie from 
the video position that was left on closing the file. 
This is quite annoying when users can’t watch the video at 
a single shot. Also, VLC does not restart the playback 
where left off. There are many other features which user 
find missing. In order to make over this inadequacy, the 
users can add the additional features and customize 
options by using VLC extensions and plugins.

In this article, we provide some tricks on how to install 
and use the extensions on the VLC media player. But before
we begin its worth mentioning that most of the extensions 
are offered for desktop version while there are only a few 
for the mobile version of the VLC app. Also, the add-ons 
need to be installed manually, and users have to enable
the installed extensions by manual operations.
